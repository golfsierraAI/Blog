## What is CSRF?

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It occurs when a malicious website, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site where the user is currently authenticated.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Target**: Authenticated users
* **Method**: Exploits the trust a website has in a user's browser
* **Impact**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim
* **Severity**: Can range from minor inconvenience to complete account takeover

## How CSRF Attacks Work

CSRF attacks exploit the way web browsers automatically include credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) with requests to a particular domain. Here's the typical attack flow:

### The Attack Process

1. **User Authentication**: The victim logs into a legitimate website (e.g., banking site)
2. **Session Establishment**: The browser stores authentication cookies
3. **Malicious Site Visit**: The victim visits a malicious website or clicks a crafted link
4. **Forged Request**: The malicious site triggers a request to the legitimate site
5. **Automatic Authentication**: The browser automatically includes the stored cookies
6. **Unauthorized Action**: The legitimate site processes the request as if it came from the user
